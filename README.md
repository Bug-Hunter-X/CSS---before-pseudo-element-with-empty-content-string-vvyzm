# CSS ::before Pseudo-element with Empty Content String

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in CSS related to the `::before` pseudo-element and its interaction with the `content` property when an empty string or only whitespace is used.

## Bug Description

The `content` property of the `::before` pseudo-element is expected to insert generated content into the document.  However, providing an empty string '' does not generate an empty inline element as one might expect. It simply results in no generated content.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Open `bug.css`
2. Examine the CSS for the `.element::before` selector. Note that the `content` property is set to an empty string.
3. You will observe that no content is generated by the selector.

## Solution

To generate a visually empty element, use a non-breaking space (`&nbsp;`) or other character that will not affect layout but satisfies the requirement of the `content` property for non-empty content.

See `bugSolution.css` for the corrected code.
