The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the `content` property and `::before` pseudo-element, specifically when used with an empty string or whitespace characters only:

```css
.element::before {
  content: ''; 
}
```

This will not produce any visible effect.  The `content` property expects a value and does not treat an empty string as creating an empty inline element. To create a visually empty element, we should use a non-breaking space or similar technique.
